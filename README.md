# FagusAnalyses
This repo includes the R script for replicating the analyses of the distribution of Fagus sylvatica across western Europe (Italy, France and Spain) presented in the manuscript _USE it: uniformly sampling pseudo-absences within the environmental space for applications in habitat suitability models_. The R script of the analyses provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the [**USE**](https://danddr.github.io/USE/) R package (by Daniele Da Re, Enrico Tordoni and Manuele Bazzichetto) to uniformly sample pseudo-absences within the environmental space for species distribution modelling. Information on how to install the R package [**USE**](https://danddr.github.io/USE/) through devtools::install_github can be found within the R script (Fagus_example).

Data used: [WorldClim](https://www.worldclim.org/data/index.html) bioclimatic variables (through the function raster::getData), sPlotOpen ([Sabatini et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.13346)), and EU-Forest ([Mauri et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.123)). The sPlotOpen and EU-Forest datasets can be found [here](https://idata.idiv.de/ddm/Data/ShowData/3474?version=54) and [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Occurrences_location_shapefile/3497891?backTo=/collections/A_high-resolution_pan-European_tree_occurrence_dataset/3288407), respectively. Note that these datasets may be updated in the future, so results presented in the R script may change accordingly. Please, e-mail manuele.bazzichetto@gmail.com to get the same version of the data used for the analysis of _Fagus_. Also, note that the code in this repo is meant as a step-by-step description on how to use the USE package, and do not represent a thourough analysis of the distribution of _Fagus sylvatica_. Finally, WorldClim, sPlotOpen and EU-Forest are open datasets, but please check their data usage license and follow the guidelines included in the related publications for citation.

The R script is roughly divided in three sections:
1) Data from the above-mentioned sources are downloaded (WorldClim) and cleaned for the analyses;
2) The uniform sampling of the environmental space is implemented (using the USE package) to i) apply kind of a spatial thinning procedure for subsetting presence data of _Fagus sylvatica_, and ii) collecting pseudo-absences within the environmental space;
3) The obtained training and testing datasets are used for calibration and validation of the species distribution model, respectively. Models are fitted using a binomial generalised linear model and random forest.
